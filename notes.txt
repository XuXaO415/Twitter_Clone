How is the logged in user being kept track of?

What does @app.before_request mean?
What is Flaskâ€™s g object? 

This application uses request hooks, in particular,
the decorator "@app.before_request". before_request registers a function
to run before each request. Sometimes it is useful to execute code before or after each request is processed.
For example, in our case, we are creating a database connection and loading a logged in user
from our database and storing it as g.user (g [context] global as storage)

What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
